### Added

- Adds support for [hApp-bundles](https://github.com/holochain/holoscape/tree/master/example-bundles) to `hc run`. This enables complex hApp setups with multiple DNAs and bridges to be easily run during development without having to write/maintain a conductor config file. [#1939](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1939)
- Adds ability to validate entries with full chain validation when author is offline [#1932](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1932)
- Adds a conductor level stats-signal that sends an overview of instance data (number of held entries etc.) over admin interfaces. [#1954](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1954)
- Adds parameters to conductor RPC function `debug/state_dump` to select portions of the state to be send instead of always receiving the full dump (which can get big if the instance holds many entries). [#1954](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1954) 
### Changed

- data sent via jsonrpc to the conductor interface for agent/sign, agent/encrypt and agent/decrypt must now be base64 encoded
