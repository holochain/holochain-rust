### Added

- Adds smarter ordering of pending validation. Builds a dependency graph and only will try to validate entries that do not have dependencies also awaiting validation as this will always fail. [#1924](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1924)
- Adds support for [hApp-bundles](https://github.com/holochain/holoscape/tree/master/example-bundles) to `hc run`. This enables complex hApp setups with multiple DNAs and bridges to be easily run during development without having to write/maintain a conductor config file. [#1939](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1939)
