## [0.0.48-alpha1] - 2020-05-14

### Added

- added an optimization of not querying the DHT for get links requests that are placed on a node's own agent id because we must be responsible for holding that part of the DHT. [#2189](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/2189)
- added an optimization for sim2h to not re-fetch entries we've fetched within the last second. [#2185](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/2185)

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

- two conductor fixes during error cases (like base hasn't arrived yet) in hold_aspects request: [#2184](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/2184)
    - stop incorrectly recording aspects as held
    - stop locking up the future
- because sim2h doesn't get error messages from a hold_aspect request it must also not record aspects sent in those messages as held, and thus the conductor must explicitly send back a list of aspects held after a hold_aspect request [#2184](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/2184)
- update futures crate because of dependency issues.  [#2188](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/2188)

## [0.0.41-alpha2] - 2019-12-19

### Added
- Adds support for setting the agent name and id via a parameter with hc run by calling `hc run --agent-name MyAgentName`. The `%agent_id` is generated from the name. This allows multiple hc run conductors to be used on the same machine. It will be overwritten by the `HC_AGENT` environment variable.
- Adds support for sim2h with hc run by calling `hc run --networked sim2h --sim2h-server wss://localhost:9000`.
- Adds support for [hApp-bundles](https://github.com/holochain/holoscape/tree/master/example-bundles) to `hc run`. This enables complex hApp setups with multiple DNAs and bridges to be easily run during development without having to write/maintain a conductor config file. [#1939](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1939)
- Adds ability to validate entries with full chain validation when author is offline [#1932](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1932)
- Adds a conductor level stats-signal that sends an overview of instance data (number of held entries etc.) over admin interfaces. [#1954](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1954)
- Adds parameters to conductor RPC function `debug/state_dump` to select portions of the state to be send instead of always receiving the full dump (which can get big if the instance holds many entries). [#1954](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1954)
- Added new docker boxes dedicated to faster CI tasks through incremental compilation
- Added `CARGO_CACHE_RUSTC_INFO=1` to nix shell

### Changed

- data sent via jsonrpc to the conductor interface for agent/sign, agent/encrypt and agent/decrypt must now be base64 encoded
- circleci config now uses version 2.1 syntax
- added the `-x` flag to several nix-shell commands
- using `command -v` instead of `which` in app spec `build_and_test.sh`
- standardised all app (proc) spec commands into a single paramaterised command `hc-test-app-spec`
- updated to holonix `v0.0.54`
- `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is now set explicitly in the nix shell hook
- renamed `hc-conductor-wasm-install` to `hc-conductor-wasm-bindgen-install`
- core `shellHook` can now override holonix `shellHook`
- several `--target-dir` flags are removed in favour of `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR`
- the passphrase hashing config is now set to faster and less secure parameters to reduce the start-up time of conductors a lot, esp. on slow devices. (will become a setting the user can choose in the future - faster and less secure config is fine for now and throughout alpha and beta) [#1986](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1986)

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

- paths in cluster test are no longer hardcoded in a way that breaks `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR`
- `cli` and `conductor` are now both uninstalled again after running app spec tests
- Fixes a panic in the sim2h server that can happen if the last node of a space leaves just as a second node connects. [#1977](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1977)

### Security

## [0.0.40-alpha1] - 2019-12-01

### Added

- Pruning the State of old/stale/history data to prevent it from using up a slowly but infinitely growing amount of memory. [#1920](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1920)

### Changed

- Exchanged [vanilla thread-pool](https://docs.rs/threadpool/1.7.1/threadpool/) with the futures executor thread-pool [from the futures crate](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.1/futures/executor/index.html). This enables M:N Future:Thread execution which is much less wasteful than having a thread per future. Number of threads in the pool is kept at the default (of that crate) of number of CPUs. [#1915](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1915)
- Replace naive timeout implementation (for network queries / direct messages) that uses a thread per timeout with a scheduled job that polls the State and sends timeout actions when needed (reduces number of used threads and thus memory footprint) [#1916](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1916).
- Use the [im crate](https://docs.rs/im/14.0.0/im/) for `HashMap`s and `HashSet`s used in the redux State. This makes cloning the state much cheaper and improves over-all performance. [#1923](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1923)

- Add hdk::version_hash, returning MD5 hash of HDK build environment [#1869](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1869)
- Add --info option to conductor to return info on the version including HDK_VERSION & HASH as well as GIT_HASH & GIT_BRANCH if the binary was compiled from a git repo [1902](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1902)
- Ability to set storage backend for new instances over RPC [#1900](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1900)
- Tracing of HDK API function calls within a zome function call to be used for debugging and in Holoscape's debug view [#1885](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1885)

### Changed

- Several improvements to gossip related code, both in sim2h server and core [#1884](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1884/files):
  * Sim2h server will not just randomly pick a node to fill missing aspects, but it caches the information which aspects are missing for which node and will not ask a node about an aspect it doesn't have (gets rid of the `EntryNotFoundLocally` error).
  * In core's list responses: merge authoring list into the gossip list so sim2h has gossip sources that are the authors of entry aspects.
  * Clear sim2h server's caches about nodes when they disconnect. Also forget the whole space when the last node disconnectse.
- `DhtStore::holding_list` which stored only the hashes of entries being held got changed to `DhtStore::holding_map` which is a map of entry address to set of aspect addresses so we know explicitly which aspects are held for each entry. This helps debugging (and already revealed a bug which is fixed in this version too) and enabled several simplifications in core logic. [1904](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1904)

### Deprecated

- Fixed infinite gossip loop due to non-deterministic creation of virtual chain header headers [1904](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1904)

* Adds a network back-end: `sim2h` and all corresponding integration. [#1744](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1744)

  [Sim2h](https://github.com/holochain/sim2h) is the next iteration of sim1h.
  In contrast to sim1h, it does not use a centralized database but a
  centralized in-memory network that connects Holochain instances
  like a switch-board.

  It is much faster than sim1h and will be able to implement Holochain
  membranes based on the agent IDs and the `validate_agent` callback.

  It can be used by configuring conductors like so:
  ```toml
  [network]
  type = "sim2h"
  sim2h_url = "wss://localhost:9000"
  ```
  with `sim2h_url` pointing to a running `sim2h_server` instance.

  This also adds nix-shell commands:
  - `hc-sim2h-server-install` which installs the sim2h-server
  - `hc-sim2h-server-uninstall` which removes the sim2h-server
  - `hc-sim2h-server` which starts the server with on
    port 9000 (can be changed with `-p`) and with  debug logs enabled
  - `hc-app-spec-test-sim2h` which runs the integration tests with
    networking configured to sim2h (expects to find a running
    sim2h_server on localhost:9000)

*  Adds the `--properties`/`-p` flag to `hc package` which takes a stringifed JSON object to be inserted in the .dna.json under the properties field. This will alter the DNA hash and can therefore be used for fork DNAs from their source code. [#1720](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1720)
* Adds publishing of headers again after rollback. Header publishing is now its own action rather than part of the `Publish` action that plays nicely with the testing framework. It also adds header entries to the author list so they are gossiped properly. [#1640](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1640).
* Adds some deadlock diagnostic tools to detect when any mutex has been locked for a long time, and prints the backtrace of the moment it was locked [#1743](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1743)

## [0.0.31-alpha1] - 2019-10-03

### Added

* Adds publishing of headers again after rollback. Header publishing is now its own action rather than part of the `Publish` action that plays nicely with the testing framework. It also adds header entries to the author list so they are gossiped properly. [#1640](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1640).

* Adds new networking back-end `sim1h` which can be configured in conductor config with:
    ```toml
    [network]
    type = "sim1h"
    dynamo_url = "http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    [#1725](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1725)
* Adds nix-shell commands for running app-spec tests with different network implementations
  - `hc-app-spec-test-sim1h`
  - `hc-app-spec-test-n3h`
  - `hc-app-spec-test-memory`

  [#1725](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1725)

* Adds nix-shell commands for running a local DynamoDB instance:
  - `dynamodb` and
  - `dynamodb-memory`

  [#1725](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1725)

* Adds zome+function name to ConsistencyEvent::Hold representation for pending zome function call returns for better hachiko timeouts. [#1725](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1725)

* Adds `UUID` to DNA configs which will change the DNA when initializing an instance with it and sets the given UUID. This disables the hash check of the DNA if set. [#1724](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1724) [#1725](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1725)

### Changed

### Changed

- *Breaking Change* Validation callback now shows consistent behavior when called on the authoring node during entry commit time, and when called by validating nodes being requested to hold the entry.  In both cases the a FullChain validation package now does NOT include the about-to-be-added entry.  Some validation functions were relying on the behavior of having the entry be at the top of the chain in the Hold case, and using the EntryLifecycle flag value to distinguish the two cases.   Please note that in the future this flag may be going away! [#1563](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1563)
- *Breaking Change* Format of `.hcbuild` files that are run by `hc` changed: `steps` is now an array so we have deterministic ordering of build steps. - In order to apply WASM size optimizations to our app-spec test suite, we had to make more sophisticated use of the `.hcbuild` files with a sequence of consecutive steps. The former implementation with a map had to changed to an array. [#1577](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1577)

- **BREAKING:** Conductor configuration checks for bridges added [#1461](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1461). Conductor will bail with an error message if the configuration of bridges between instances does not match the bridge requirements defined in the caller instance's DNA (required bridge missing, DNA hash mismatch, trait mismatch) or if a bridge with the handle specified in the config can not be found in the caller's DNA.

- Adds Zome API function `hdk::sleep(std::time::Duration)` which works the same as `std::thread::sleep`.[#935](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/935)
- All structs/values to all HDK functions must implement `Into<JsonString>` and `TryFrom<JsonString>` (derive `DefaultJson` to do this automatically) [#854](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/854)
- HDK globals `AGENT_ADDRESS`, `AGENT_ID_STR`, `DNA_NAME` and `DNA_ADDRESS` are now set to real, correct values. [#796](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/796)

- Admin RPC functions added to container interface. Any (websocket) container interface that is configured with  `admin = true`  now can call a number of functions to remotely change any aspect of the container config. [#840](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/840)
- Adds a set of functions to the container RPC for managing static UI bundles and HTTP interfaces to these.  See rustdoc of `conductor_api::interface::ConductorApiBuilder` for a full description of these functions. [#919](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/919)
- Conductor can now serve static directories called ui_bundles over HTTP that can be configured in the container config toml file. This HTTP server also implements a virtual json file at "/_dna_connections.json" that returns the DNA interface (if any) the UI is configured to connect to. Hc-web-client will use this to automatically connect to the correct DNA interface on page load.  [#885](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/885)
- Adds Zome API function `hdk::remove_link(base,target,tag)` for removing links.  [#780](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/780)
