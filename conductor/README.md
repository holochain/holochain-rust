This crate implements a reference Conductor for serving Holochain DNAs.

## Install

Our recommended pattern for the installation of the conductor is to download the binary for your platform from our [releases](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/releases) page. Otherwise, you can proceed with the more complex instructions for building from source, below.

### Building From Source

These dependencies need to be installed in order to compile, and use `holochain`:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
  - needs to be the `nightly-2019-01-24` build, so use the following commands, once you have first installed Rust
  - `rustup toolchain install nightly-2019-01-24`
  - `rustup default nightly-2019-01-24`
  - Also, if you are going to be developing Zomes in Rust, install the WASM build target for Rust, by running:
  - `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly-2019-01-24`


To install the cutting edge version of the Holochain conductor, run the following command in a terminal
```shell
$ cargo install holochain --force --git https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust.git --branch develop
```

To install the latest released version of the Holochain conductor, run the following command in a terminal
```shell
$ cargo install holochain --force --git https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust.git --tag v0.0.9-alpha
```

The Conductor should then be available from your command line using the `holochain` command.

Run `holochain --version` to confirm that it built.

## Usage
