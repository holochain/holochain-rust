   # Installation

   This release includes binaries of:

   - the [`hc` development command-line tool](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/blob/${tag}/cli/README.md)
   - [`holochain` deployment conductor](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/blob/${tag}/conductor/README.md) for different platforms.

   ## Very much recommended install

   The recommended installation process is to follow the [developer quick-start guide](https://developer.holochain.org/start.html).

   The approach in the quick start guide:

   - provides additional supporting tools like rust & node
   - shows you how to keep up to date with the latest versions of everything
   - makes minimal changes to your machine overall
   - is relatively difficult to screw up

   ## Bothersome manual install

   **IMPORTANT:** Manual holochain installations can conflict with the installer.

   Either binary is installed by being placed anywhere on your `$PATH`.
   This is different for everyone and depends how your machine is configured.

   For `hc` to build and test DNA Rust and NodeJS are both needed.

   ### Which Rust?

   The binaries for this release were built with rust from holonix version ${holonix-version}.
   WASM needs the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` rust target on your toolchain.

   ### Which NodeJS?

   Node is used to run end to end tests as a client of the holochain.
   Holochain exposes websockets for node to interact with.

   We recommend nodejs 10+.

   ### Which Binary?

   Download the binaries for your operating system.

   - MacOS: `cli-${tag}-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
   - Linux: `cli-${tag}-x86_64-generic-linux-gnu.tar.gz`
   - Windows:
     - Visual Studio build system (default): `cli-${tag}-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.gz`
     - mingw build system: `cli-${tag}-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.tar.gz`

   All binaries are for 64-bit operating systems.
   32-bit systems are NOT supported.
