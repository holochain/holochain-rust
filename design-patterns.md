### Design Patterns 

We are using currency transaction design patterns. These are reputation graphs whose final weights are calculated from the perspective of the user (search/index/query patterns). 

We are using user authorization patternsâ€”for example, invite code, web of trust, KYC proof, pre-authorized public key. Other design patterns we are using are the access and privileges patterns, such as private DHT forks, private source chain data, and encrypted data on the DHT.

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context, also known as an abstraction. Holochain provides a framework for building better decentralized and net neutral dApps. So using its design patterns can leverage your ideas.
