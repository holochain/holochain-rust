# Building Holochain Apps: User Interfaces

Holochain is designed to be flexible and accomodating when it comes to building user interfaces. There is not a single approach to developing user interfaces that is enforced by Holochain, though there are some approaches that have extra tooling, support and focus. First and foremost, Holochain supports APIs that make building UIs with the technologies of the web (HTML, CSS, JS, etc) easy.

Put simply, it is entirely possible to build a user interface for Holochain completely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
