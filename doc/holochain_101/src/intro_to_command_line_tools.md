# Intro to Command Line Tools

There are a set of custom-designed tools for working with Holochain that can be installed as utilities to your command line to simplify and accelerate the process of Holochain app development. These command line tools are required if you wish to be able to attempt what you are reading about as you continue through the articles on building an app.

To install the command line tools, use the [quick start installation guide](https://developer.holochain.org/start.html).

In addition to the installation instructions, [the README](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/tree/v0.0.4/cli#usage) has an overview of the different functions of the command line tools. You will also learn these organically just by proceeding through the other articles in this chapter and the ones that follow.
