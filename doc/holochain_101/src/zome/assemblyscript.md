# Writing in Assemblyscript

As mentioned in [writing in Rust](./rust.md) Assemblyscript is a language based off of Typescript, which is designed to compile to WebAssembly. It is hoped that Assemblyscript will soon be mature enough, and have the necessary features, to be able to have an HDK for it. Work on an HDK for Assemblyscript commenced mid 2018, but hit roadblocks.

Updates on this should appear in a number of places: 
- [the Holochain medium publication](https://medium.com/holochain)
- [the hdk-assemblyscript repository](https://github.com/holochain/hdk-assemblyscript)
